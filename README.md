### [Background and Overview](#background-and-overview)

  The goal of this project is to identify negative revenue transactions in e-commerce data, which are often indicators of refunds, returns, or potential anomalies. By detecting these transactions proactively, businesses can better manage inventory, customer behavior, and operational risks.

  We approached this problem using machine learning, specifically the XGBoost classifier, leveraging historical transaction data to predict whether a new transaction might result in negative revenue. This allows for data-driven decision- 
  making rather than manual inspection.






### [Data Structures Overview](#data-structures-overview)
Data Sources:

The primary dataset comes from [Kaggle Dataset: E-commerce Transactions](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/carrie1/ecommerce-data), containing e-commerce transactions.
Additional transactions may be simulated or provided for testing the model.

## Raw Columns:

InvoiceNo ‚Äî Unique identifier for each invoice

StockCode ‚Äî Product code

Description ‚Äî Product description

Quantity ‚Äî Number of items per invoice

InvoiceDate ‚Äî Date of 

UnitPrice ‚Äî Price per unit

CustomerID ‚Äî Unique identifier for the customer

Country ‚Äî Customer country

## Feature Engineering:

Revenue = Quantity √ó UnitPrice

NegativeFlag = 1 if Revenue < 0, else 0 (target variable

Recency, Frequency, Monetary (RFM):

Recency ‚Äî Days since last purchase

Frequency ‚Äî Number of purchases

Monetary ‚Äî Total monetary value of purchases

These features were chosen to summarize customer behavior and feed into the XGBoost model

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Descriptive statistics: mean, median, min/max, standard deviation for numeric columns.

Distribution plots: histograms and boxplots to check for outliers and distribution shapes.

Categorical analysis: counted occurrences of product categories, payment types, or regions involved in negative transactions.

Identified patterns in negative transactions over time, product, or customer segments

## Data Cleaning

Handled missing values: checked columns with nulls (df.isnull().sum()) and decided whether to fill, drop, or leave them.

Standardized column names (removed spaces, converted to lowercase).

Removed duplicates to avoid double-counting transactions.

Converted data types where necessary (e.g., order_date to datetime, amounts to numeric).


# üìâ Negative Quantity Transactions Over Time

### [Executive Summary](#executive-summary)

After training the XGBoost classifier:

Objective: Predict whether a transaction is likely to be negative.

Data Split: 70% train / 30% test

Performance Metrics:

Accuracy: 100%

Precision: 100%

Recall: 100%

F1-score: 100%

Key Findings:

The model perfectly classified negative and non-negative transactions in the test set, as reflected in the confusion matrix: all 78,547 non-negative transactions were correctly identified, and all 1,774 negative transactions were correctly predicted.

A precision of 1.00 indicates that every predicted negative transaction was indeed negative, with no false positives.

A recall of 1.00 shows that the model captured all actual negative transactions, with no false negatives.

The F1-score, combining precision and recall, confirms excellent balance between accuracy and completeness.

These results demonstrate that the feature set and preprocessing were highly effective for this classification task, providing strong confidence in the model‚Äôs predictive power.

Such high performance may also indicate the dataset is well-structured, possibly with distinct patterns separating negative transactions from others, which the XGBoost algorithm captured efficiently.

The model is highly effective at detecting negative transactions (high recall).

Negative transactions are often associated with unusual RFM patterns, such as high recency with low monetary value

### [Insight Deep Dive](#insight-deep-dive)
Based on the insights from the model and feature analysis, the following actions are recommended:

1. Targeted Customer Monitoring

Flag customers who exhibit infrequent purchases with sudden high refunds for closer review.

Implement real-time alerts for high-risk transactions to prevent potential losses.

2. Regional and Product-Specific Controls

Focus on countries or product categories that historically show higher negative transaction rates.

Consider stricter verification or additional checks for high-risk regions or product types.

3. Transaction Policies & Rules

Introduce spending/refund thresholds that trigger automated review workflows.

Monitor for unusual patterns that deviate from typical customer behavior (frequency, monetary value, recency).

4. Operational & Fraud Prevention Measures

Use the model predictions to prioritize investigation resources, reducing manual review load.

Update risk scoring systems dynamically as new transaction data arrives.

5. Continuous Model Improvement

Retrain the XGBoost classifier periodically with new transaction data to capture evolving patterns.

Incorporate additional features if available, such as payment method, device type, or order channel, to further enhance predictive power.

6. Strategic Decision-Making

Leverage insights to adjust return/refund policies, marketing incentives, or customer loyalty programs.

Reduce financial leakage by focusing on the highest-risk segments identified by the model.






























### [Recommendations](#recommendations)

Business Actions:

Real-time Monitoring: Continuously track flagged negative transactions on interactive dashboards to quickly respond to potential issues.

Targeted Investigation: Review top-flagged invoices to identify fraud, processing errors, or unusual return patterns.

Policy Optimization: Adjust return/refund policies, promotional campaigns, or customer incentives based on observed trends to minimize financial risks.

Next Steps:

Model Deployment: Automate the XGBoost classifier as a scheduled pipeline (daily or weekly) to proactively flag high-risk transactions.

BI Integration: Connect predictions with Power BI or Tableau dashboards for clear executive-level visibility and decision-making.

Continuous Learning: Collect and label new transaction data over time to retrain and enhance model accuracy, adapting to evolving customer behaviors.

Impact: Implementing these recommendations will help the business reduce losses from negative transactions, optimize operational workflows, and maintain data-driven decision-making for transaction monitoring.
